## Getting started

Before you begin:
- This program is powered by Python 3. Please verify you have all [important libraries](README.md#requirements) installed.
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/AnnikenYT/SduiAPI/issues) & see if we [accept contributions](#types-of-contributions-memo) for your type of issue.

### Check if your issue already exists

Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/AnnikenYT/SduiAPI/issues) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.
  - Are you making changes to the application code? You'll need **Python 3.\*** to run the program locally.
  - Are you contributing to markdown? We use [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The whole community thanks you. :sparkles:

Once your PR is merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in the [contributor chart](https://github.com/AnnikenYT/SduiAPI/graphs/contributors).

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Reviewing
We review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use this program.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems. Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.
